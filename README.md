# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Species Classifier

Welcome to the **Iris Species Classifier** project! This repository contains the code for a web application that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its features. The app uses a Random Forest Classifier to make predictions, providing a reliable and robust model for this classic dataset.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets used in machine learning. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features:

- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**

The goal of this project is to classify the iris flowers into one of the following species:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit.
